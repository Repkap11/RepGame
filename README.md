## RepGame

RepGame is a simple game, modeled after Minecraft, mostly to learn about OpenGL.
RepGame was created by @Repkap11. RepGame is written in C/C++.


## Building on Linux
RepGame requires some dependencies to be installed on the your system before you can build. You can install these dependencies automatically by running 'make install' and typing your sudo password. After that, you can run "make linux" to build the project for Linux. Other platforms like "windows", "android" and "wasm" can be build from a Linux host as well. The target "linux-run" can be used to build and run the Linux build for easier testing.
